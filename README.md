# what it does?
this program takes 4 methylation arrays for each time point 
and graph the min(TP)-max(TP)
for each CpG
currently you need to set the CpG list manually in the main.py file
in the future you would be able to load a CpGs list file (.txt \ .cpg)

# how to use it?
## requinments 
tkinter, pandas, matplotlib

download the program,
run it through an IDE (i did not check if it runs though the terminal yet)
choose files (TP1,TP2,TP3,TP4)
choose location to save the graph 
graphs would be represented in the location graph

currently it ask each image for location, i might fix it
